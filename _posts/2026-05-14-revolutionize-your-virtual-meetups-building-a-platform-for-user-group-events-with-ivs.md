Zoom? Teams? Any other number of subscription-based platforms? I asked Claude for suggestions. All the usual players, some new ones. In my previous life, I'd pay the $100/month and move on.

But why not take a page out of the 'vibe coded a CRM' playbook and build something using IVS? So I let Kiro build it for me.

Now, I did expect it to work perfectly the first time (spec-driven development solves the shortcomings of AI, right?). Ultimately, it probably spanned 3 days and it's not perfect, but close enough for me to be comfortable with using it in a month. Despite a very detailed spec, I had to go back through and remind Kiro of some things, do a lot of deployments, and a lot of manual testing (but I have 280 automated tests LOL).

It's been through a W-A-R (NO, IT'S NOT A WAFR), can be branded for your own community (like a HAM radio club), runs on AWS, deploys via CDK, is serverless, and maybe costs a few dollars an event. Actually, the domain cost more than I envisioned this to cost for the foreseeable future. Donations accepted.

In the end, it's pretty neat, will be on GitHub soon, licensed in a friendly manner (as soon as I figure out which one), and has a ton of features (nothing earth-shattering). Can you think of anything I missed?
